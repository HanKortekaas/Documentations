title: Announcements

Kunena has a system to show Announcements in the frontend for example to display the latest news or something very important that the users can see always. Announcements support BBCode and Emoticons.

In Kunena, there are two ways to do this:

**_Backend -> Components -> Kunena Forum -> Configuration -> Frontend -> Look and Feel:_ Show Announcement = Yes** (default).
To create an announcement select Announcements in the frontend **_Profile Box_** and Add New. The announcements need a title and you have the choice to fill a short text and a long text, or only the short text.
Always in the Kunena frontend, you have a control panel for the management of all announcements. Like the article manager in Joomla, you have the possibility to edit, publish/unpublish or delete an announement. If you have various announcements, only the last one is displayed in the Announcement position. If you want see more, click on the Announcement.
All Administrators & Global Moderators can create Announcements.

Alternatively, you can use Kunena [Module_Positions](../../faq/module-positions) (for announcements its the position `kunena_announcement`) to place a module, allowing you the possibility to put anything in there: Graphics, html, flash, advertising....
