title: 'Coloured Categories'
---

One of the features of **Kunena** is the way that categories can be customised with different colours. Applying a different colour "theme" to different categories, forums within categories and topics within forums, is really quite easy.

##### How it's done

If you want to display a **_specific_** category in one of the pre-defined colours that exists with the template, use the Category Manager, **_edit_** the specific category, **_Categories -> Category Display -> (tab) Category Name and Description -> Category CSS Class Suffix_** to one the following values:

* -blue
* -yellow
* -grey
* -red
* -pink
* -green
