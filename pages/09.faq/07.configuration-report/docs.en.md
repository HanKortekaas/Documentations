title: 'Configuration Report'
---

In Kunena there is a way to post a summary of your system and configuration settings using the icon **_Tools -> [Report Configuration](../../manual/backend/tools/report-configuration)_**. This will generate pre-formatted content with some BBCode to paste directly into a post at the Kunena.org forum. This info will give us the details we need to help you with problems you might be having.
Simply **Select all** the generated text, choose Edit -> Copy in your browser, and then use Edit -> Paste to include that text in your post on the Kunena forum. Don't worry, any sensitive information is only visible by Kunena.org moderators. It's very important that you do NOT edit any of the information contained in this generated text.
