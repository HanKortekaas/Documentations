Although we have done our best to document as much as possible here in the documentation, it is inevitable that there will be questions we have not answered.  We want to be accessible as possible, so we have several methods to reach the developers in order to get help directly:

#### Forum

We have a [forum](http://www.kunena.org/forum) to provide a simple way to get your Kunena questions answered quickly.

#### Twitter

We **highly recommend** you [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kunena) as that provides a real-time way for us to reach out to our followers and let them know about news and events related to Kunena development.

#### Kunena Blog

You can join in a discussion on any of the topics we post about on the [Kunena Development Blog](http://www.kunena.org/blog), via the comments.  We will post all major news and information to our blog, as well as useful posts about development in general. We also plan to share great tutorials and hints about how get the most out of Kunena.

#### GitHub Issues

If you find a bug, have a general question, or even if you want to contribute to the Kunena project as a whole, you can use the [Kunena GitHub Issues tracker](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/issues).
