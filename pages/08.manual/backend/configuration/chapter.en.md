The Kunena Configuration feature allows users to tailor Kunena's functions to their specific site needs.  This feature allows, for example, users to decide what they will call their forum page, whether forum messages can be posted by anonymous users or only by registered users of the site, and whether other third-party components (like private messaging) are to be used.  Many of the choices can be made according to individual tastes; some, however, may cause unexpected consequences if they're not handled correctly.

As a general guide, the default settings that ship with Kunena's installation kit will be adequate for most purposes. However, some suggested tips are offered in the article Configuration Tips.
