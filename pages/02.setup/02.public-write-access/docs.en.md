It is recommended that, if you allow guests to post messages in your forum, you should use some form of spam defence or counter-measure; if you allow guests to post messages in your forum, it is suggested that you also set the value for the option [Display Captcha](../../faq/captcha-spam-protection).

##### Another option is Moderate Guests
