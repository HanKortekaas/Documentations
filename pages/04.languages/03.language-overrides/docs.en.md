Sometimes it happens that you want to change a text passage or a word. Or you want just a language key displayed (such as COM_KUNENA_PUBLISH). This can be easily changed, Joomla offers the feature of the language override.

### Overwrite text

* Go to **_Backend -> Extensions -> Language(s) -> Overrides_**
